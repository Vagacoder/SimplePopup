07/30/2019
========================
1. Test the idea of popup window using react
2. The mechanism:

    2.1. the popup HTML-DOM is 100% wide and 100% high, so that it covers 
      whole window, any other DOM elements are not interactable.
      
    2.2. the elements inside popup DOM are aligned to center, the background
      of popup DOM is black with the opacity of 0.5. So that other elements
      are visible but dim.
